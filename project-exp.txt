->Using Jenkins and its shared libraries you have ensured that your application code is bug-free and secure too.
->Later on you build the image and push the image to a private ECR using Docker.
->Then using terraform you have created the necessary infrastructure such as a VPC, SGs, ALB, RDS, ACM.
->We have created the eks using terraform and cluster upgrades also we did it using terraform.
 we have to update aws kube config in workstation which use for application deployment.  
 (aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 expense-dev)
 (post running this command will get .kube folder and which we have authencation and authorisation)
->Workstation etc for your application deployment.
->At last you have deployed the application to the EKS cluster.
->Hope this gives you a better understanding of how to integrate all the tools together.
