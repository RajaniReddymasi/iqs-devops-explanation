Using Jenkins and its shared libraries you have ensured that your application code is bug-free and secure too.
Later on you build the image and push the image to a private ECR using Docker.
Then using terraform you have created the necessary infrastructure such as a VPC, SGs, EKS, ALB, RDS, ACM,
Workstation etc for your application deployment.
At last you have deployed the application to the EKS cluster.
Hope this gives you a better understanding of how to integrate all the tools together.
