hello, I'm rajani having 9 years of exp in IT industry.
I have worked in multiple domains like banking , insurance and Airline
Currently i'm working as SRE engineer in CME group.
chicago and mercentile exchange group, which is the worlds largest marketing derivatives place, where people trade contracts about future prices.
As pert of clearence team, working for BPS and GPS apps.
I'm responsible for clearence apps if any issue, we will be performing a trade test from clearing apps to make sure apps are working fine.
we are responsible for maintaining infrastructure reliability, 
handling user issues, and managing deployments across both production and disaster recovery (DR) environments.

☁Disaster Recovery (DR) Activities:
We have a DR environment that can be activated when needed.
As part of the UC4 job automation setup in Kubernetes, we manage a master job plan that controls application start/stop across multiple regions.
During DR activation, all applications are started simultaneously.
If there are latency issues or delays in startup, we verify whether the system can clear the backlogs or recover automatically.

Any failures or inconsistencies are handled in the DR environment first, and if critical, a Change Request (CR) is raised.

🔄 Change Management & Automation (GitOps/CD):
We are involved in the Change Management process, where we:
Raise CRs for changes impacting production.
Review, test, and deploy changes once approvals are received.

We follow a GitOps approach:
Developers make changes to the code, Jenkins piepline will trigeer
once build pipeline get execute>unit>static code analysys>all success > docker build triggered
and it pushed to ECR repo of GCR/ECR>
deployment we are using GITops process using Argo Cd
once image is build with latest changes we have ardo image updater it will update the pod image to latest one
then argo cd will deploy the changes to kubernater.

but the deployment is managed entirely by the SRE team.
We have control over Continuous Deployment (CD). Only the SRE team has the privilege to merge and deploy changes to production.
We also manage CI/CD pipelines and ensure stability during rollouts.


most of the clearing apps are in migration phase , which are moving to GKE of google cloud.
we have entire obeservability is running in google.
like slos, 
95% of API Callls should finesh under 4 seconds
98% of API calls should finish under 3 seconds

dashboards: Latency= Average Processing time, Errors and Transaction count we have
alert monitoring also in place with pager duty alerts
if any issue with clearing apps which are on prem checking the app status and finding the logs 

i'm working i'm working on pod automation, log checkout and prober checkout.

DR activity we have occationally.

TECHNICAL SKILLS:

VPC and VPC CIDR decided by arc
Public which subnet have internet access, IGW
private subnets which subnet doesnt have internet access — NAT gatewat (whic will available in public subnet)
db servers which should not directly expose to public,
internet gateway which assigned to VPC
security groups, NAcls, routes

using terraform you have created the necessary infrastructure such as a VPC, SGs, ALB, RDS, ACM.
->We have created the eks using terraform and cluster upgrades also we did it using terraform.
->Using Jenkins and its shared libraries we have ensured that your application code is bug-free and secure too.
by using quality gates (code quality )
sonar cube - code quality/vulnerabilities
trivyscan - containers

->Later on you build the image and push the image to a private ECR using Docker.

->At last i have deployed the application to the EKS cluster.
->Hope this gives you a better understanding of how to integrate all the tools together.

->Then 
 we have to update aws kube config in workstation which use for application deployment.  
 (aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 expense-dev)
 (post running this command will get .kube folder and which we have authencation and authorisation)

comming to daily activities our project is like financial sector its hihgly secure. so we are following mostly blue green deployment

1. rolling updates  : rolling update have no zero downtime
ex: you have 4 replicas for 1 application and when you deploying new version first out 4, 1 will change to new 
_____________________

2. this we can keep when we create a canary service canary: 5% of production users in ingress service 
https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/canary/  (fyi, you will get all info)
ingress contoller installation-ingresss service

_________________________
blue & green is safe and costly:
will create new deployment in green nodes, 
we redirect the the traffic from ingreess by changing the service to green, load balancer will point to green

-----------------------

cluster upgrade:
1. blue and green nodes should be available
2. traffic will be available only in any of the nodes either in blue or green
3. the new nodes for example green are new then we should cordon(not ready for scheduling) the nodes
4.new nodes should cordon as this green nodes will not have any pods
(scenario:if any issue with control plane , we dont see any issue for application. 
Bcz nodes are associated with alb, 
new deployments will fail if control plane is down and existing app will not cause any issue if control plane is down)
5. once cluster updated, green nodes also update it.
6. uncordon green nodes
7. drain the blues nodes

1.st will deploy in green nodes
2. will redirect the traffic using loadbalancer

load balancers
classic load balancer ( which is deprecated now)
application load balancer (path based/context based/host based — layer 7 http/htpps)
network load balancer (milliones of reqs per second — web servers — tcp/tls, udp traffic)
Alb as target to NLB

cross accounts,
ec2 -s3
interface endpoints / gateway endpoints
instead of allowing the traffic to reach the ec2 instances over the internet,

2 vpcs connection — vpc peering
2 different cidr blocs
we have to accept the request
we have to add the route

10 vpcs — transist gateways

AWS lambda — serverless architectre ,

RDS — credentilas
ssm paramets store, AWS secret manager and we can use them
IAM role — policy

load balancer — health check — ttl
load balancer will not send traffic to unhealthy servers

Autoscalling — based on demand
lauch template
tragets

lister rule

application is fine — 1 server is down

high availability — 1 node is down 1 instance will up

servers getting unhealthy — after how to check — latest deployments cause

SNS — email id / slack id , it will send mails we have to subcribe them

authentication — IAM

r53 — dns records
A record IPV4 — alias records
c name — canonical ,
load balancer dns — www. abc.com — A record -

ec2 — no IGW
gateway endpoints

Kubernetes Networking:
1. Pod-to-Pod Communication: Each Pod->own IP->allowing direct communication->other Pods across nodes-> cluster.
2. Services: Kubernetes provides Services with virtual IPs (ClusterIPs) to allow access to Pods in a stable and scalable way.
3. DNS: Kubernetes automatically assigns DNS names to Services, allowing Pods to communicate using names instead of IP addresses.
4. Ingress: For HTTP(S) traffic, Ingress resources can route external requests to internal Services based on path or hostname.
5. Network Policies: Kubernetes allows you to define Network Policies to control communication between Pods for security.
6. CNI Plugins: Kubernetes uses CNI plugins to manage networking, ensuring Pods get IP addresses and can communicate across the cluster.
